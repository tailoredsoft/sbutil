Note: On Linux if 'wine' will need to be installed when xcompiling locally
      then if not on host, use following command to install:-
          sudo apt-get install wine
      
      On Ubuntu 20.xx or newer, to install pyserial use following commands:
          sudo apt-get install python3-pip
          pip3 install pyserial
